///
/// ## CMU-CS-95-113:  2.1 Overview
///
/// > Rete uses a dataflow network to represent the conditions of the productions.
/// > The network has two parts. The alpha part performs the constant tests on
/// > working memory elements (tests for constant symbols such as red and left-of).
/// > Its output is stored in alpha memories (AM), each of which holds the current set
/// > of working memory elements passing all the constant tests of an individual condition.
/// >
/// > [...] The beta part of the network primarily contains join nodes and beta memories.
/// > Join nodes perform the tests for consistency of variable bindings between conditions.
/// > Beta memories store partial instantiations of productions (i.e., combinations of WMEs
/// > which match some but not all of the conditions of a production). These partial
/// > instantiations are called tokens.
/// >
/// > [...] the alpha network performs not only constant tests but also intra-condition
/// > variable binding consistency tests, where one variable occurs more than once in
/// > a single condition; [...]
/// >
/// > [...] the basic idea is that the alpha network performs all the tests which involve
/// > a single WME, while the beta network performs tests involving two or more WMEs.

/// > When a WME is added to working memory, the alpha network performs the necessary
/// > constant (or intra-condition) tests on it and deposits it into (zero or more)

///
/// ## CMU-CS-95-113:  2.2.3 Exhaustive Hash Table Lookup
///
/// > For any given WME, there are at most eight alpha memories that WME can go into.
/// > This is because every alpha memory has the form `(test-1 ^test-2 test-3)`,
/// > where each of the three tests is either a test for equality with a specific
/// > constant symbol, or a "don't care," which we will denote by "*".
///
/// > If a WME `w = (v1 ^v2 v3)` goes into an alpha memory `a`, then `a` must have
/// > one of the following eight forms:
///
/// > - `(*  ^*   *  )`
/// > - `(*  ^*   v3 )`
/// > - `(*  ^v2  *  )`
/// > - `(*  ^v2  v3 )`

/// > - `(v1 ^*   v3 )`
/// > - `(v1 ^v2  *  )`
/// > - `(v1 ^v2  v3 )`
///
/// > These are the only eight ways to write a condition which `(v1 ^v2 v3)` will match.
/// > Thus, given a WME `w`, to determine which alpha memories `w` should be added to,
/// > we need only check whether any of these eight possibilities is actually present
/// > in the system. (Some might not be present, since there might not be any alpha memory
/// > corresponding to that particular combination of tests and *'s.

    ///
    /// > This is needed to ensure that newly added productions are immediately matched
    /// > against the current working memory. The procedure's job is to ensure that the given
    /// > new-node's left-activation procedure is called with all the existing matches for
    /// > the previous conditions, so that the new-node can take any appropriate actions
    /// > (e.g., a beta memory stores the matches as new tokens, and a p-node signals new
    /// > complete matches for the production). How update-new-node-with-matches-from-above
    /// > achieves this depends on what kind of node the new-node's parent is.
    /// >
    /// > If the parent is a beta memory [...], this is straightforward since the parent
    /// > has a list (items) of exactly the matches we want. But if the parent node is
    /// > a join node, we want to find the matches satisfying the join tests, and these may
    /// > not be recorded anywhere. To find these matches, we iterate over the WMEs and tokens
    /// > in the join node's alpha and beta memories and perform the join tests on each pair.
    /// >
    /// > The pseudocode below uses a trick to do this: while temporarily pretending the new-node
    /// > is the only child of the join node, it runs the join node's right-activation procedure
    /// > for all the WMEs in its alpha memory; any new matches will automatically be propagated
    /// > to the new-node.
