/// > Whenever the propagation reaches the bottom of the network, it indicates that
/// > a production's conditions are completely matched. This is commonly implemented
/// > by having a special node for each production (called its production node,
/// > or p-node for short) at the bottom of the network. [...]
/// >
/// > Whenever a p-node gets activated, it signals the newly found complete match.
///
/// ## CMU-CS-95-113:  2.3.3 P-Node Implementation
///
/// > A p-node may store tokens, just as beta memories do; these tokens represent complete
/// > matches for the production's conditions. (In traditional production systems, the set
/// > of all tokens at all p-nodes represents the conict set.) On a left activation, a p-node
/// > will build a new token, or some similar representation of the newly found complete match.
/// > It then signals the new match in some appropriate (system-dependent) way
///
/// > In general, a p-node also contains a specification of what production it corresponds to â€“
/// > the name of the production, its right-hand-side actions, etc. A p-node may also contain
/// > information about the names of the variables that occur in the production.
