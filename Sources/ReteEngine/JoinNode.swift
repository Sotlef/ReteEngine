///
/// > [...] a join node can incur a right activation when a WME is added to its alpha memory,
/// > or a left activation when a token is added to its beta memory. In either case, the node's
/// > other memory is searched for items having variable bindings consistent with the
/// > new item; if any are found, they are passed on to the join node's children.
///
/// > The data structure for a join node, therefore, must contain pointers to its two memory
/// > nodes (so they can be searched), a specification of any variable binding consistency tests
/// > to be performed, and a list of the node's children. From the data common to all nodes
/// > (the rete-node structure [...[), we already have the children; also, the parent field
/// > automatically gives us a pointer to the join node's beta memory (the beta memory is always
/// > its parent). We need two extra fields for a join node:
///
/// ```
/// structure join-node:
///     amem: alpha-memory  { points to the alpha memory this node is attached to }
///     tests: list of test-at-join-node
